# Capstone_Final_Project_GUVI
Project of EDA, Model UI, Image Preprocessing, NLP, Recommendation System

### Project Overview
* The objective of this project is to predict whether an e-commerce visitor will convert into a customer. Understand OCR, Image Processing, NLP and Product Recommendations.
* Data-Driven Insights: Analyzing and preprocessing historical data and train the model for improved predictions.
* ML Model: Predicting the lead conversion using Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM models.
* Classification Model: Classifying leads into “Converted" or “Not converted" categories using count of session, clicks and device category.
* Streamlit Application: Developing an interactive web-based application for real-time prediction and decision-making, providing a user-friendly interface for entering input features and obtaining actionable predictions.
* Streamlined Workflows: Incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization techniques to ensure robust model performance and accurate predictions.
